# UdonWaterInteractions

Make your VRChat world's water more immersive with sounds and particle systems that provide feedback for your hands, head, and body.

## Demo world

This was made originally for my [Waterfall Pool world](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_b2b5f60e-5162-490f-a7c5-a8fa46ea7dc5), you can see it in action there.

## Installation

Drag the .unitypackage from releases into your Unity project and import everything.

## Usage

- Drag the prefab from Cekay/WaterInteractions/Prefabs into your scene
- Create a new layer for your water interactions, and specify that in the prefab's menu
- Go to the water gameobject in your scene, and add a new trigger collider, putting it on your new water layer
- Hit play and splash around!
